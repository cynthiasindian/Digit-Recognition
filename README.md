# Digit-Recognition
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately recognizes handwritten digits. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model is trained on the popular MNIST dataset to achieve high accuracy in identifying digits from 0 to 9.

Features
-Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and normalized the MNIST dataset for optimal performance.
-Model Architecture: Built a CNN model with multiple layers to extract features and classify digits.
-Training and Validation: Trained the model using the training dataset and validated it on the test dataset.
-Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of 98.42% on the test set.
-Deployment: Created an interactive demo to showcase the model's digit recognition capabilities.
